### Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser

COVID-19 is spreading like a wild fire and all we hear is use a mask, practice social distancing and keep your hands clean. Hand sanitizer is the best way to get rid of all the harmful germs and viruses on our hands but what if a healthy person uses a contaminated dispenser which was previously used by an infected person. Then the same hand sanitizer becomes a cause for spreading the deadly virus.
This project is about creating a touch free automatic hand sanitizer dispenser using arduino to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
